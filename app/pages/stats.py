    This page presents the **four main visualizations** used to evaluate
    the model‚Äôs performance and behavior.  
    Each image represents a different aspect of the analysis and is explained below:

    # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Class Balance
    st.header("1Ô∏è‚É£ Class Balance")
    st.image("../images/Smote.jpeg", caption="Distribution of classes in the dataset")

    **What does it show?**  
    It represents how many samples exist for each type of astronomical object:  
    - **CONFIRMED**  
    - **CANDIDATE**  

    **Why is it important?**  
    An **imbalanced dataset** (where one class has many more samples than the others)
    can cause the model to learn in a biased way.  
    This graph helps determine whether **resampling or class weighting techniques** are needed
    to improve training balance.

    # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation with KOI Disposition
    st.header("2Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation with the Independent Variable (KOI Disposition)")
    st.image("../images/Correlation.jpeg", caption="Correlation matrix between features and KOI disposition")
    st.markdown("""
    **What does it show?**  
    The **strength of the relationship** between numerical features and the final disposition (`koi_disposition`).  
    Each cell indicates how strongly two variables are correlated (values range from -1 to 1).  

    **Why is it important?**  
    It helps identify **which features contribute the most** to the model‚Äôs decisions
    and whether there are **redundant or less useful variables**.  
    Values close to **1 or -1** indicate strong relationships, while values near **0** indicate weak correlations.
    Negative values indicate that the variables are **inversely proportional**.

    # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Scatter

    st.markdown("""
    **What does it show?**  
    A collection of scatter plots comparing pairs of variables.  
    Each point represents a dataset observation with its corresponding values for two features.  

    **Why is it important?**  
    It helps visualize **trends, patterns, and outliers**:  
    - If points form lines or curves ‚Üí a relationship exists.  
    - If points are widely scattered ‚Üí the variables are likely independent.  

    This visualization helps understand the **structure of the data before model training**.

    # 4Ô∏è‚É£ Confusion Matrix
    st.header("4Ô∏è‚É£ Confusion Matrix")
    st.image("../images/ConfusionMatrix.jpeg", caption="Comparison between predicted and actual values")
    st.markdown("""
    **What does it show?**  
    It compares the **true classes** with the **predicted ones** produced by the model.  
    Each cell indicates how many cases were correctly or incorrectly classified.

    **Why is it important?**  
    It provides a detailed look at the model‚Äôs performance:
    - The **main diagonal** represents correct predictions.  
    - Values outside the diagonal correspond to misclassifications.  

    From this matrix, we can derive metrics such as:
    - **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, **Accuracy**, and **ROC-AUC**,  
    which provide a comprehensive evaluation of model performance.
